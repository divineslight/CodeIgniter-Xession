# Xession - Codeigniter Session Library

## Description

The CI's native session library was working quite fine for me until recently, no matter what I do it just breaks if I store a tiny bit of data. Still after 5 years we encountered SAME issue in a new project again.

Hence I wrote a simple wrapper that is almost identical to CI's Session Library, but uses PHP's tested and proven native Sessions. It also provides the flash data functionality.

## Installation

Just put 'Xession.php' in your CI/application/libraries
