# Xession - Codeigniter Session Library

* [Developed for http://loop.pk](http://loop.pk)

## Description

The CI's session library was working quite fine for me until recently it failed to work for one of my friend, no matter what he did it just broke. Later in my one or two projects it also started 
showing weirdness.

Hence I wrote a simple wrapper that is almost identical to CI's Session Library, but uses PHP's tested and prove native Sessions. It also provides the flash data functionality.

## Installation

Just put 'Xession.php' in your CI/application/libraries
